This problem focuses on building a machine learning model that can predict whether a person has diabetes based on their medical data. The goal is to analyze health-related attributes such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin levels, BMI, and age to identify patterns that distinguish diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
Using a labeled dataset, we aim to train classification algorithms that can accurately predict the presence of diabetes, which can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning. This kind of predictive system not only improves efficiency but also plays a vital role in preventive healthcare.
